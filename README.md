## Introduction

**TreeViewer** is a cross-platform program to draw phylogenetic trees. It is based on a "modular" approach, in which small _modules_ are used to perform individual actions (such as computing the coordinates of the nodes of the tree, or drawing the tree branches) that together contribute to the final plot.

Each TreeViewer module has a user manual, and these can be displayed in TreeViewer by opening the `Module Manager` window (from the `Edit` menu) or by clicking on the various question mark (`?`) icons that are shown throughout the program when appropriate.

TreeViewer is written using .NET 5 and is available for Windows, macOS and Linux operating systems. It consists of the main GUI program and a command-line utility that can be used to plot trees that are too large to be previewed on-screen in real time. It is licensed under a GNU Affero GPLv3 license.

This branch contains the source code for the [TreeViewer website](https://treeviewer.org). You can access the main TreeViewer branch from [here](https://github.com/arklumpus/TreeViewer).
